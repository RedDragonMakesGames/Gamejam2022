    - speaker: 
      sentence: "It was a hard battle, but we were able to overwhelm the Woodsman
        and make our escape. I didn\u2019t know I had this kind of strength in me."
    - speaker: 
      sentence: " I can\u2019t take all the credit here, however. If it weren\u2019t
        for Wolf, we would not be here right now. "
    - speaker: 
      sentence: "Before long, I\u2019d see my grandmother\u2019s cottage in sight,
        at which I\u2019d be greeted with her warm smile and her loving embrace."
    - speaker: 
      sentence: 'She was alarmed about Wolf for a brief second, but I was quick to
        tell her that he was a new friend that helped me through the forest. After
        some time telling her what we had gone through, she was shocked by it all. '
    - speaker: 
      sentence: 'Despite that, she was proud of me for being so brave and strong,
        and she was thankful to Wolf for helping me the entire way through. So much
        so, she asked if he would like to stay with her as protection. '
    - speaker: 
      sentence: "With nowhere to go, he agreed. Now, we had a new member of the family,
        and we were able to spend more time together. While this may not be how the
        story usually goes, I\u2019d say it\u2019s better that way."
