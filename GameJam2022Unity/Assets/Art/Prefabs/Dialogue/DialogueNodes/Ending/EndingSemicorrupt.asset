    sentences:
    - speaker: 
      sentence: Wolf and I defeated the Woodsman. It was true that he was a strong
        opponent, but working as one, we bested him with our strengths combined.
    - speaker: 
      sentence: "With him gone, the path to my grandmother\u2019s house was open
        to us, allowing us to escape from the forest. "
    - speaker: 
      sentence: "As much as this experience has helped me to bond with Wolf ever
        since we first met, I\u2019d like to forget any of this happened and put
        everything we\u2019ve gone through behind us."
    - speaker: 
      sentence: Surely, my grandmother would be understanding of what had happened.
    - speaker: 
      sentence: 'Unfortunately for me, that would not be the case. As soon as we
        arrived, she would see Wolf and be terrified by the sight of him. '
    - speaker: 
      sentence: "She had mistakenly believed that it was because of him that she\u2019d
        find me ragged and bruised."
    - speaker: 
      sentence: 'He ran immediately upon seeing the hostility she had towards him,
        and while I wanted to say something to defend him, my grandmother was more
        focused on making sure I was okay. '
    - speaker: 
      sentence: "So while I was able to come home safe, I never got the chance to
        say goodbye to Wolf and thank him properly for all he\u2019s done. Deep down,
        I can\u2019t help but wonder what things would have been like had he stayed."
