    - speaker: 
      sentence: 'No matter who faced us, they were nothing to us. One by one, our
        enemies fell, allowing us passage through the forest. '
    - speaker: 
      sentence: "Not even the Woodsman was able to stop us as we went down our last
        stretch of land before making it to my grandmother\u2019s house. "
    - speaker: 
      sentence: "What awaited us there wasn\u2019t the warm smile of my grandmother,
        but instead a scared gaze as she saw Wolf and me framed in the threshold
        of our current position. "
    - speaker: 
      sentence: "She didn\u2019t know what we went through, and she never will. The
        sight of our battle-hardened visage proved too much for the old hag\u2019s
        heart. If she couldn\u2019t handle the sight of the new me, then so be it."
    - speaker: 
      sentence: "She can die knowing that I wasn\u2019t the same defenseless little
        girl that she knew before. I would call myself alone, but that wasn\u2019t
        true. I had Wolf to be there with me now. "
    - speaker: 
      sentence: "While he couldn\u2019t speak anymore, he wished to embrace his new
        look more openly. Not that I blame him. He wouldn\u2019t have been much help
        to me, to begin with, had he not succumbed to this newfound power. "
    - speaker: 
      sentence: "As such, he searched through my grandmother\u2019s clothes and slipped
        them on himself, thanks to his newfound hands.  "
    - speaker: 
      sentence: "Now, we live together in this little house. No one to bother us,
        threaten us, hurt us\u2026 Because they knew better than to anger us."
