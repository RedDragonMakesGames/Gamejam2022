    - speaker: 
      sentence: "Hello there. My name is Red. You may know me from the classic tale
        where a young girl in a red hood walks through a forest and fends off against
        a wolf while on her way to her grandmother\u2019s house. "
    - speaker: 
      sentence: "It\u2019s a story told throughout the ages, and I\u2019m living
        it right now. However, it\u2019s not quite the tale that you\u2019re expecting
        it to be\u2026"
    - speaker: 
      sentence: "While I was on my way to my grandma\u2019s humble tiny home, the
        same wolf that was supposed to be my enemy turned out to be anything but.
        This one was friendlier, coming to me with a warning."
    - speaker: 
      sentence: " A Woodsman that looked\u2026 abnormal. Vicious. Corrupt. This Woodsman
        shows no mercy to those he stumbles across, and this wolf happened to be
        one of his targets before he escaped. "
    - speaker: 
      sentence: 'Just by looking at me, he knew that if I were to trek this forest
        alone, I would not survive even a minute. '
    - speaker: 
      sentence: "Therefore, I suggested that we should work together to get through
        the forest, so we can escape from the Woodsman and reach my grandmother\u2019s
        home. "
    - speaker: 
      sentence: "Hesitantly, he agreed, and so we set off on our perilous journey
        through the massive forest, our main goal being to survive\u2026"
